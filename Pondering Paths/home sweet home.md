Asked GPT to explain and it did so beautifully



Here's a breakdown:

1. /challenge/run is the executable that, when run, will generate or retrieve the flag.
2. The program accepts a path argument that tells it where to save the flag.
3. The constraints specify that the path must:
   - Be an absolute path (e.g., start with / or ~).
   - Be inside your home directory (so ~ will expand to /home/hacker).
   - Be three characters or fewer before any expansions.

So, by running /challenge/run ~/x, you're:
- Calling the program /challenge/run.
- Telling it to save the flag at the path ~/x, which expands to /home/hacker/x (a valid absolute path in your home directory).

In summary:
- /challenge/run is the program you need to run.
- ~/x is the argument that specifies where the program should write the flag, satisfying the three-character and absolute path constraints.
