# More catting practice 

```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/firefox/browser/flag
pwn.college{ghGeRcgswqarbohROrXdV7i3JFv.dBjM5QDL4ETN0czW}
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ 

```

Used cat command to read a file.

  use of cd was restricted but it was not required anyways!
