# Intro to commands


``` bash
Connected!                                                                        
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EDy7LLfJHoC_CHgGEXw6barlOi-.ddjNyUDL4ETN0czW}

```


This challenge was to basically invoke a basic command in the command line prompt.
One point to remember is that Linux is case-sensitive, so hello and HELLO are different!
