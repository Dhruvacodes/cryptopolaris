# Intro to arguments

The first word is command, and the subsequent words are argument.

The echo command is used to give back the argument.

In this case, we are using the hello command with the hackers argument to get the key.

```bash
Connected!                                                                        
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c5ImuT5IZVDECkTjoXOXprfK0iB.dhjNyUDL4ETN0czW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$
```
